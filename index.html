        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Rina and I am a first year Psychology student at the University of California, Riverside. I have had little professional experience in the field of psychology thus far, but hope to gain more experience over the next few years. The only professional experience I have had in the working world thus far was my time working at the Sprouts Farmer Market grocery store. From my time there I learned about the importance of communication, punctuality and providing good customer service. Some overall qualities of mine are the fact that I am a very driven, detail oriented, and organized worker. I am a great team player and continuously communicate with fellow peers while working on tasks. Iâ€™m very passionate about helping others and contributing to the field of psychology in any way that I can. Mental health is a very prevalent issue for millions of people and being able to support people through their mental health journeys is very important to me. I hope to get involved in the clinical field of psychology or maybe even the industrial organizational field. Both seem incredibly interesting and important. Although both fields really interest me, clinical psychology is one field that has always felt extra intriguing to me as it is more hands on. I myself have known many people in my life including close friends and family that have dealt with mental struggles and getting involved with a career that helped others with these same issues is something really important to me.
